- 👋 Hi, I’m @charlesdemetrios
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to be a good front-end developer, because my job as a B2B technology marketer search engine optimization (SEO) consultant could benefit from a new skill.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate nothing, because I'm bad at this.
- 📫 But you can reach me at www.hellobios.com if you have any question!
